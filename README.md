## About This Project

This portfolio was built as a dynamic, single-page application to serve as a central hub for my software development work. It demonstrates my ability to build a complete web application from the front-end user interface to the back-end data handling. The primary goal was to create a clean, responsive, and professional site using a modern .NET technology stack.

## Tech Stack

This project was built using the following technologies:

* **Framework:** **Blazor Server** - For building an interactive, server-side web UI with C#.
* **Language:** **C#** - The primary language used for all application logic.
* **UI Component Library:** **MudBlazor** - A material design component library for Blazor that provides pre-built, responsive UI elements.
