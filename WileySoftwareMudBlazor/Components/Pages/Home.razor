        Welcome to my Portfolio
        Hi, I'm Chris Wiley, an cybersecurity aficionado with nearly 30 years of IT experience. I am taking TCM Security courses in ethical hacking and penetration testing, focusing on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities to help organizations build a stronger security posture. 
        <br />
        My skills are a result of both my extensive professional background and a continuous, hands-on approach to learning, as demonstrated by my rankings in global CTF competitions and my active pursuit of the Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) certification.
