        My journey with technology started early, sparking a lifelong passion for everything from computer repair to deep-dive programming. For the past seven years, I've served as a Junior QA Analyst, a role that has refined my ability to find weaknesses and ensure quality.

        Now, I'm channeling that same dedication and love for learning into cybersecurity, specifically in the field of penetration testing. I'm actively pursuing the TCM Security PNPT certification and am a quick study who enjoys creating my own effective methods to solve complex problems. As a collaborative team player who seeks out new challenges, I'm excited to bring my unique perspective to the cybersecurity field.
